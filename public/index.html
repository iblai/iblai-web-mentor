      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative field of computer science
      that enables machines to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks such
      as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. By
      leveraging algorithms and vast amounts of data, AI systems can analyze
      patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time
      without explicit programming. From virtual assistants and autonomous
      vehicles to healthcare diagnostics and financial forecasting, AI is
      revolutionizing industries, enhancing efficiency, and opening new
      frontiers for innovation. As AI continues to evolve, it raises important
      ethical and societal questions about privacy, fairness, and the future of
      human-machine collaboration.
